# ETL pipeline and documentation

An ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is a process that extracts data from one or more sources, transforms it into a format suitable for analysis, and loads it into a target system such as a data warehouse or a data lake. ETL pipelines are commonly used in data integration, data migration, and business intelligence applications to consolidate and transform data from multiple sources into a unified format.

## What is ETL

An ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is a set of processes that extract data from various sources, transform it into a consistent format, and load it into a target database or data warehouse for analysis and reporting. The ETL pipeline is a critical component of a data integration system, which is used to consolidate data from multiple sources and transform it into a standardized format for analysis and decision-making

The ETL pipeline typically consists of several stages, including:

1. Extraction: In this stage, data is extracted from multiple sources, such as databases, files, web services, and APIs.

2. Transformation: In this stage, the extracted data is transformed into a consistent format that is suitable for analysis.
   The transformation process can involve data   cleaning, data mapping, data aggregation, and other data manipulation tasks.

3. Loading: In this stage, the transformed data is loaded into a target database or data warehouse, where it can be accessed by users for analysis and reporting.
